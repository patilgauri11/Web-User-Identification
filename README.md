# Web-User-Identification
Data Description Description: Web-user identification is one of the important problems in behavioural psy-chology. Here we try to identify a user on the Internet by tracking his/her sequence of visited Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session (a sequence of ten webpages visited consecutively by the same person) along with the start time of visit for a webpage and predict whether it belongs to Alice (1) or somebody else (0)t. ### The train_data contains information on user browsing sessions where the features are: site_ - ids of sites in this session. time_ - timestamps of attending the corresponding site target - whether this session belongs to Alice One can use the original data train.zip to form a train set differing from train_sessions.csv. ## Added Time Features days_:Days of Week Binary_Days:Whether days are weekdays or weekends Shift: timestaps of whole days 0:6(hr)- “night” ; 6:11(hr)-“morning” ;11:16(hr)-“aftenoon” 16:19(hr)“evening” 19:24(hr)-“night1”
